# A sample Bowerfile
# Check out https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails#ruby-dsl-configuration for more options

#Once you are done with bower.json or Bowerfile you can run

#rake bower:install to install packages
#rake bower:install:deployment to install packages from bower.json
#rake bower:update to update packages
#rake bower:update:prune to update components and uninstall extraneous packages
#rake bower:list to list all packages
#rake bower:clean to remove all files not listed as main files (if specified)
#rake bower:resolve to resolve relative asset paths in components
#rake bower:cache:clean to clear the bower cache. This is useful when you know a component has been updated.
#If you'd like to pass any bower CLI options to a rake task, like -f, -j, you can simply do:
#
#rake bower:install['-f']
